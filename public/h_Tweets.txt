@MojoRuckus @TrumpWarRoom The Trump campaign's internal polling is far more accurate and doesn't show Trump just winning, but winning "bigly".

He popularized, worldwide, the anti-semetic conspiracy theory that inspired Nazis. They awarded him medals and Hitler had his portrait in his office.
Trump is not just incompetent but malevolent. He isn’t killing people by accident. Malignant narcissists feel “omnipotently destructive” when they cause mass deaths, which they always do. That means we are in even more danger than we realize https://t.co/X0zVLM5tUA

@DonaldJTrumpJr Wow, trying to make something out nothing is a true Trump. Donald Jr, you're as low as your Father. Everyone already knows the Trump's our racist people.
Michigan AG and Governor comment about a viral video of a demonic Michigan nursing home worker punching and abusing a defenseless elderly person:

“President Trump did not wear a mask at the Ford plant He doesn’t care about Michigan’s safety. SCCCCCCRRRRREEEEEECCCCCHHHHHHH!”
@RepAdamSchiff State Dept. IG (Linick) investigated Hillary &amp; informed the public about her server.

Clinton-Obama did not fire Linick.

Linick investigated Pompeo, but
Pompeo-Trump fired him.

Under 18 USC §1505, whoever corruptly obstructs a civil investigation must be fined and/or imprisoned
Adam Schiff, the Democrat’s impeachment ringleader, said that our country would have had less coronavirus-related deaths if President Trump had been impeached and removed from office. This is absolutely outrageous and Schiff must apologize immediately! https://t.co/jKBDVxkPVr
@realDonaldTrump I love how all the liberals in the comments posting nasty comments about Trump not knowing what he’s talking about are all unaware of the vicious attack he is bringing light to due to the Media’s REFUSAL and FAILURE yet again to cover things that don’t fit their narrative. Sad.
This morning on “The Breakfast Club” - the presumptive Democratic nominee @JoeBiden said this- “If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black."    🤔
“The larger truth here is now undeniable: The Obama Administration spied on the political competition, it continued that spying even after Mr. Trump was elected, and then it tried to cover up what it had done.” https://t.co/4klTnUKri4
Hey Ragging Cajun @JamesCarville as always all you do is spin bullshit! The only reason @BillClinton beat Bush was Ross Perot! This dog don’t hunt in 2020! https://t.co/IXYKO9t6D7

Joe Biden declared Friday morning that if black Americans are unsure whether to support him or Trump in November, "then you ain't black." https://t.co/dSN3XPu0Ar
Trump lashes out at anybody who dares to point out how wrong he is. https://t.co/7vpdagBmiu
@ResistwaveNow @danwon86 Every time I watch Trump or Biden I end up saying to myself F both of them.
@Chris11962 Like he shouldn't have? Seeing how Trump IS Putin's Puppet, he's in Putin's pocket. Putin owns him, Putin owns America and Putin owns you.
Wherein the presumptive Democrat candidate for president, Joe “Creepy, Sleepy, Beijing” Biden tells a black man he “ain’t black” if he thinks about voting for Trump.

Just... wow. https://t.co/Ce4V3j79zt
COUNTDOWN CONTINUES: 23 days left until Trump fires State Dept's IG. A week has passed and, except for some requests for information that Trump will ignore, there's been no action. It's time for the House to schedule a hearing. It's time for Republican Senators to grow a spine.⏱️ https://t.co/RyKU7EYYEd

Susan Collins voted along party lines to confirm Trump pick, arch-conservative John Ratcliffe, as Director of National Intelligence. He has no experience. His only selling point is his devotion to Donald Trump. Susan Collins must go.
@getbusy5 @sinbad333 @EricTrump Well, where’s the proof? And don’t give me a Breitbart article. Why isn’t the Trump DOJ looking into it?
.@JoeBiden: "If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black." 

@cthagod: "It don't have nothing to do with Trump, it has to do with the fact -- I want something for my community."

@bennyjohnson The worst thing is Trump has done more for them in 3.5 years than the half black Pres and Joe did in 8!
And, hopefully, for Trump too! https://t.co/BsyQuFiDHq
@besf0rt Remember Trump’s birther movement against Obama? His criticism of a federal judge because he was “Mexican”? Calling Mexicans murderers and rapists? African countries shitholes? Muslim ban. Calling nazis fine people. 

This isn’t even close. Trump is a racist. #Biden2020 #GoJoe
@jerrylmassey @____Roar____ @ExMissionary @Pearleyjewels @BabeTruth2 How do you Photoshop a video? Granted, it’s hard to swallow that even his wife hates him.

Trump not wearing a mask is not a sign of toughness. It’s a sign of vanity. It’s a sign he thinks he’s better and more important than everyone else. And it is this ignorance, selfishness, and anti-science attitude that brought preventable mass death to America.
@_Michelangelo__ @SpeakerPelosi Hey. Maybe Nancy will get together with Chucky and SCHIFTY and impeach Trump for not wearing a mask! He violated a democratic opinion! 😂
This is the first true thing Breitbart has ever published, can I get a retweet Donnie? @realDonaldTrump

The corona virus is from immigration.  Labor shortages don't exist.  The journalists lie.  Get the facts.  Get The Macroeconomic Laws by Gregory Del Jones, available on the net.  Re-elect Trump.
@swaknan @MaQualeSantone @ibdran989 @b_momani No one can fix what G.W. Bush and Obama did to the ME. Not Trump for sure.
@NATTURN52350670 @seanhannity You should be smart enough to know better than to listen to the fake polls. President Trump will win by a landslide provided the Dems don't cheat ....example throwing out mail in ballots.
Retweet if you think this sounds racist AF!!!

Imagine if Donald Trump said this… https://t.co/cyrzWWgmaJ
@Lowbrowdefense @washingtonpost Trump ain't strong. He's an elite. A born elite. Why do Trumpeteers hate people that pull themselves up by their own bootstraps?
@el_mansfield @KennethPKrey @Gogs_7 I don't think competency is the main issue unfortunately. As a foreigner, it seems to me that Biden will merely continue the reckless foreign policy and close connections to Wall St. seen by presidents ever since Reagan. Better than Trump can still be really, really bad.
Naeto will smoke Vector hit for hits sha. Vector will decimate Naeto lyrically. Reason why the comparison is vexing me is, if you combine Vec and Naeto, MI will still trump them. It’s not even fair. https://t.co/w42hLfTjyb

Trump wears lifts in his shoes, a girdle, Depends, a fake tan and a dead ferret on his head while standing like a drunk centaur as he tours the Ford Factory. But he won’t wear a mask because he thinks it would make him look stupid. @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/uFZeQVD6GK

Don't anyone doubt for a second that whoever wrote Trump's speech saying Henry Ford had "good bloodlines" knew Henry Ford wrote a pamphlet called "The International Jew: The World's Foremost Problem."
