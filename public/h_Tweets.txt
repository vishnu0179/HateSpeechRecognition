Chappati/roti - Flatbread
Chai - chai tea 
Lokum- Turkish Delights 
Atayef- sweet pancakes 
Muslim - paki
Enforcement agencies in India are blatantly communal &amp; anti Muslim. The only solution is that Muslims should be given proportional representation in police. This was also recommended by Sri Krishna committee in 1993. Congress never implemented it despite ruling for 15 years.
Masjid Al-Aqsa is not ONLY for Palestinians. It is for all Muslims. Freeing Masjid Al-Aqsa IS a Muslim cause. Freeing Palestine IS a Muslim cause. If Prophet Mohammad (SAAW) were here today you don’t think he would want to free the lands around Al-Aqsa?
